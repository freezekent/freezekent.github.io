I am a quantitatively trained social scientist with expertise in Chinese politics, development finance and economics, and international affairs.  I love working with data and making it accessible to others.    
  
I developed this site as a place to publicly share some of my work - while this is somewhat altruistic (I like creating data tools that people can use), I am also ex-USAID and currently looking for a job and this site also serves to highlight some of my skills and interests.  

See my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHIrfevBiix5W7EmxatH4KFLlezuJrHW/view?usp=drive_link) or [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kent-freeze-1221946/) for my professional background and please reach out to chat if you think I might be able to help your organization.
